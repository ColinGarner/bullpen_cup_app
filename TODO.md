## üîß Technical Notes

### Golf Course API Integration
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.golfcourseapi.com`
- **Key Features**:
  - Course search and details
  - Tee information (slope/course ratings)
  - Hole-by-hole data (par, yardage, handicap)
  - Official handicap calculation support

### Handicap Calculation Formula
```
Course Handicap = Handicap Index √ó (Slope Rating √∑ 113) + (Course Rating - Par)
```

### Stroke Allocation Rules
- Strokes allocated based on hole handicap rankings
- Lower handicap vs higher handicap determines net strokes
- Match play: strokes given on specific holes
- Stroke play: total strokes subtracted from gross score

### Match Types & Scoring
- **Singles Match Play**: Individual vs individual with stroke allocation
- **Fourball Match Play**: Best ball of partnership with individual handicaps
- **Alternate Shot**: Partnership plays one ball with combined handicap
- **Stableford**: Points-based scoring with handicap adjustments
